      <title>Development of a Transferable Species Distribution Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://joshcullen.github.io/project/bayesian_transferable-sdm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the distributions of species is fundamental to ecology, especially within the marine environment where biotic and abiotic variables are often dynamic over space and time. Ecological models have been used to make inferences on species-environment relationships in addition to predicting past and future patterns of species distributions. However, these models are typically developed for a single location, time period, spatial scale, or species life stage, resulting in poor predictive accuracy beyond the study domain. This project will provide a new transferable modeling approach that is applicable to a wide range of species, which will be used to test predictions of current and future distributions of green turtles (&lt;em&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/em&gt;) in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, and Qatar. Since there is a lack of information on how marine turtles in general will respond to climate change impacts, these results will provide a crucial evaluation of projected range shifts that could be used by both conservationists and decision makers. This project will foster the integration of research and education through mentoring undergraduate students that identify as underrepresented minorities, teaching marine ecology and conservation at Florida State University, hosting workshops on the analysis of animal movement data, as well as hosting public outreach events. These efforts to disseminate knowledge and results beyond traditional means within the scientific community will be used to engage future scientists and the general public on pressing ecological topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall aim of this project is to develop a transferable modeling approach that can provide accurate and precise estimates of species distributions under changing conditions. This study addresses some of the challenges of model transferability through three hypotheses: 1) a model informed by biological processes and physiological constraints will exhibit greater transferability than those that do not; 2) the analysis of environmental variables at the scale of species perception will result in greater model transferability; 3) a model that accounts for differences among life stages will result in greater model transferability. These hypotheses will be tested using a large dataset of green turtle occurrences at three distant locations (Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, Qatar) with a flexible Bayesian species distribution model. The use of independent datasets (from Brazil and Qatar) to validate the species distribution model (developed on data from the Gulf of Mexico) provides a unique opportunity to critically evaluate the spatial transferability of the model. The findings from this proposed work will provide a roadmap for the further development of transferable ecological models to predict biodiversity, disease outbreaks, and risks of biological invasions across global regions and possibly under future climate change impacts. Elucidating the importance of biological mechanisms, scale, and life stage differences to ecological modeling is transformative because these factors have been largely untested with regard to model transferability. Since predictions remain a major frontier in ecology, products of this work will be of broad interest to a diverse group of scientists, such as marine ecologists, biological oceanographers, fisheries scientists, and conservationists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identifying Latent Behavioral States From Animal Biotelemetry Data Using Non-parametric Bayesian Methods</title>
      <link>https://joshcullen.github.io/project/bayesian-behavior-modeling/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Movement decisions of an organism can impact habitat use, foraging strategies, reproductive success, and survival, which ultimately affects population dynamics of a species. The study of animal movement has increased in the past few decades, along with the increased capacity of telemetry devices to record locations with greater accuracy and over longer durations. Although there are a wide variety of existing methods that estimate latent behavioral states, many of these methods have limitations for their use and inference (e.g., only analyze one data stream, require parametric distributions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed two non-parametric Bayesian models that addresses some of the limitations of these existing methods for the estimation of animal behavioral states. One of these models uses a two-stage approach: 1) Multiple data streams (e.g., step length, turning angle, temperature, depth) are partitioned into track segments for each ID; 2) Track segments are pooled across IDs and clustered to determine the optimal number of states and their distributions per data stream. This proposed framework provides a fast and flexible method to characterize latent states at the level of track segments, which may be particularly useful when time steps are short (and therefore behavior is highly autocorrelated) and when distributions of data streams are not well fit by parametric distributions. Additionally, the other method uses a mixture model to infer observation-level behavioral state estimates using the same type of non-parametric clustering approach. Both of these models can be applied using functions included within the &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshcullen.github.io/bayesmove&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;bayesmove&lt;/a&gt; package in R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-stage segment-level model is described further in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.369702v2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pre-print&lt;/a&gt; at bioRxiv while the observation-level model is described further in an article that is &amp;lsquo;in press&amp;rsquo; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19395582&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ecological Applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Space-Use and Habitat Preference of Sea Turtles in the Arabian Gulf</title>
      <link>https://joshcullen.github.io/project/sea-turtle-movement/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate change is increasingly forcing organisms to alter their movement and behavioral patterns to meet the new physical demands within their historic ranges. For animals that are already listed as endangered, such as many sea turtles species, these additional forms of stress may contribute to declining trends in population size. Populations of sea turtles in the Arabian Gulf may be among the first to feel the strongest effects of climate change since this semi-enclosed basin is one of the warmest and most saline water bodies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study evaluates the behavioral patterns and space-use of hawksbill (&lt;em&gt;Eretmochelys imbricata&lt;/em&gt;) and green turtles (&lt;em&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/em&gt;) within the Arabian Gulf tagged off the coast of Qatar. This study also evaluates drivers of turtle movement and makes predictions on habitat suitability within the Gulf as a function of behavioral state. As sea surface temperature becomes warmer for a longer duration each year, turtles will likely need to modify movement and behavioral patterns of habitat use in order to cope with this thermal stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our published work on hawksbill turtle movement ecology can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshcullen.github.io/publication/hawksbill-movement-patterns/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bioaccumulation of Organic Pollutants in Marine Organisms</title>
      <link>https://joshcullen.github.io/project/shark-body-burdens/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through multiple routes of introduction, aquatic environments are the ultimate sink for many organic contaminants. Of these compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are among the most ubiquitous. Previous studies in wildlife have  demonstrated a variety of impacts due to specific classes of these compounds, including immunosuppression, endocrine disruption, reproductive impairment, genotoxicity, and metabolic disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharks may be particularly susceptible to contaminant accumulation and exposure since they have large, fatty livers that can serve as a large reservoir for the accumulation of organic contaminants, in addition to their biomagnification as contaminant concentrations increase up the food web. Additionally, organic pollutants may adsorb to organic material such as marine snow and phytoplankton, which can be transported to the benthos where even deep-sea organisms may experience relatively high levels of exposure and accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous work has involved &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshcullen.github.io/publication/shark-body-burdens/&#34;&gt;coastal shark species&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshcullen.github.io/publication/deep-sea-burdens/&#34;&gt;deep-sea invertebrates&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshcullen.github.io/publication/marine-snow-pahs/&#34;&gt;phytoplankton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ecological Morphology of Shark Teeth</title>
      <link>https://joshcullen.github.io/project/shark-tooth-morphology/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Morphology, the structure and form of an organism, has often been used to infer an animal&amp;rsquo;s ecology since the performance and behavioral application of different structures can constrain movement and feeding. Sharks are well known for their many rows of teeth and wide variety of shapes and sizes, but less is known about how tooth shape varies over ontogeny (growth and development). Additionally, the extent of differences in tooth shape within a single set of shark jaws has widely gone untested. Since these differences in tooth shape within a single jaw or over ontogeny can have implications for feeding performance and energy expenditure, the tooth morphology of bull (&lt;em&gt;Carcharhinus leucas&lt;/em&gt;), blacktip (&lt;em&gt;Carcharhinus limbatus&lt;/em&gt;), and bonnethead sharks (&lt;em&gt;Sphyrna tiburo&lt;/em&gt;) were analyzed since they are known to undergo ontogenetic dietary shifts and each feed on different types of prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant differences in tooth morphology were only observed in bull sharks at four different positions (of six) tested. However, only one of these appears to have any functional differences in shape over ontogeny. When comparing tooth morphology throughout the jaws of each species, bull sharks exhibited the greatest heterodonty. A comparison of teeth at each jaw position among all three species found significant differences at all but two positions (where bull and blacktips were similar). These findings support the generalist feeding strategy of bull sharks that may need a greater variety of tooth shapes to process prey with different material properties. Blacktip and bonnethead sharks had much less heterodonty throughout their jaws, indicative of specialists on fish and crustaceans, respectively. It is possible that the tooth morphology of each species may confer an increased net energy intake with teeth that are well suited to process certain types of prey than other types of prey those species typically do not consume.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scaling of Bite Force in Sharks Impacts Their Ecological Niche</title>
      <link>https://joshcullen.github.io/project/shark-feeding-and-diet/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many animals undergo ontogenetic dietary shifts over their life history, especially predatory species. This is often a result of greater physical performance, prey availability, and energetic requirements. Many shark species have been documented to shift species that they consume over ontogeny, but the mechanisms facilitating this shift have not been directly addressed. One primary driver of this shift may be due to changes in bite force, which would allow sharks to potentially consume more functionally difficult prey (more evasive, larger, harder). Additionally, coastal shark species often overlap in habitat and potentially in diet. Dietary tracers, such as stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, have often been used to determine the extent of niche space and overlap among co-occurring species. Bull (&lt;em&gt;Carcharhinus leucas&lt;/em&gt;), blacktip (&lt;em&gt;Carcharhinus limbatus&lt;/em&gt;), and bonnethead sharks (&lt;em&gt;Sphyrna tiburo&lt;/em&gt;) were measured evaluate how the scaling of bite force over ontogeny influences ecological niche and overlap since these species have been previously shown to undergo dietary shifts and have distinct ecological niches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many studies that measure the scaling of bite force over ontogeny often analyze all conspecifics simultaneously, this may mask any changing patterns in bite force. Therefore, young-of-the-year and juvenile sharks of each species were analyzed separately from sub-adults and adults. This study found that the smaller shark all underwent positive allometric scaling of bite force, whereas larger sharks exhibited isometry. While rapid increases in bite force did not appear to necessarily facilitate a diet shift in blacktips, it appears that bull and bonnethead sharks may show a relationship between positive scaling and diet shifts. Bull sharks exhibited the greatest niche width, which supports their classification as a generalist predator. There was also a relatively high level of overlap of bull sharks with blacktips and bonnetheads. This was expected for blacktips, but was surprising for bonnetheads given their very little overlap in known prey species. The inclusion of a third tracer, such as sulfur, may improve the resolution of overlap among these species.&lt;/p&gt;
