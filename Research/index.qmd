## [Green Turtle Habitat Selection and Movement Patterns](GreenTurtleSDM.qmd)

This project involved characterizing the resource use (or ecological
niche) of juvenile and adult green turtles (*Chelonia mydas*) from the
Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, and Qatar. Ultimately the aims of this project
were focused on developing a statistical model that could be used to
predict relative green turtle density at locations distant from where
the turtles were tracked in this study. Interactive maps are included to
show where green turtles moved at each of these sites with respect to
environmental variables.
