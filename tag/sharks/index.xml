      <title>Bioaccumulation of Organic Pollutants in Marine Organisms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through multiple routes of introduction, aquatic environments are the ultimate sink for many organic contaminants. Of these compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are among the most ubiquitous. Previous studies in wildlife have  demonstrated a variety of impacts due to specific classes of these compounds, including immunosuppression, endocrine disruption, reproductive impairment, genotoxicity, and metabolic disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharks may be particularly susceptible to contaminant accumulation and exposure since they have large, fatty livers that can serve as a large reservoir for the accumulation of organic contaminants, in addition to their biomagnification as contaminant concentrations increase up the food web. Additionally, organic pollutants may adsorb to organic material such as marine snow and phytoplankton, which can be transported to the benthos where even deep-sea organisms may experience relatively high levels of exposure and accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ecological Morphology of Shark Teeth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Morphology, the structure and form of an organism, has often been used to infer an animal&amp;rsquo;s ecology since the performance and behavioral application of different structures can constrain movement and feeding. Sharks are well known for their many rows of teeth and wide variety of shapes and sizes, but less is known about how tooth shape varies over ontogeny (growth and development). Additionally, the extent of differences in tooth shape within a single set of shark jaws has widely gone untested. Since these differences in tooth shape within a single jaw or over ontogeny can have implications for feeding performance and energy expenditure, the tooth morphology of bull (&lt;em&gt;Carcharhinus leucas&lt;/em&gt;), blacktip (&lt;em&gt;Carcharhinus limbatus&lt;/em&gt;), and bonnethead sharks (&lt;em&gt;Sphyrna tiburo&lt;/em&gt;) were analyzed since they are known to undergo ontogenetic dietary shifts and each feed on different types of prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant differences in tooth morphology were only observed in bull sharks at four different positions (of six) tested. However, only one of these appears to have any functional differences in shape over ontogeny. When comparing tooth morphology throughout the jaws of each species, bull sharks exhibited the greatest heterodonty. A comparison of teeth at each jaw position among all three species found significant differences at all but two positions (where bull and blacktips were similar). These findings support the generalist feeding strategy of bull sharks that may need a greater variety of tooth shapes to process prey with different material properties. Blacktip and bonnethead sharks had much less heterodonty throughout their jaws, indicative of specialists on fish and crustaceans, respectively. It is possible that the tooth morphology of each species may confer an increased net energy intake with teeth that are well suited to process certain types of prey than other types of prey those species typically do not consume.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scaling of Bite Force in Sharks Impacts Their Ecological Niche</title>
      <link>https://joshcullen.github.io/project/shark-feeding-and-diet/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many animals undergo ontogenetic dietary shifts over their life history, especially predatory species. This is often a result of greater physical performance, prey availability, and energetic requirements. Many shark species have been documented to shift species that they consume over ontogeny, but the mechanisms facilitating this shift have not been directly addressed. One primary driver of this shift may be due to changes in bite force, which would allow sharks to potentially consume more functionally difficult prey (more evasive, larger, harder). Additionally, coastal shark species often overlap in habitat and potentially in diet. Dietary tracers, such as stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, have often been used to determine the extent of niche space and overlap among co-occurring species. Bull (&lt;em&gt;Carcharhinus leucas&lt;/em&gt;), blacktip (&lt;em&gt;Carcharhinus limbatus&lt;/em&gt;), and bonnethead sharks (&lt;em&gt;Sphyrna tiburo&lt;/em&gt;) were measured evaluate how the scaling of bite force over ontogeny influences ecological niche and overlap since these species have been previously shown to undergo dietary shifts and have distinct ecological niches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many studies that measure the scaling of bite force over ontogeny often analyze all conspecifics simultaneously, this may mask any changing patterns in bite force. Therefore, young-of-the-year and juvenile sharks of each species were analyzed separately from sub-adults and adults. This study found that the smaller shark all underwent positive allometric scaling of bite force, whereas larger sharks exhibited isometry. While rapid increases in bite force did not appear to necessarily facilitate a diet shift in blacktips, it appears that bull and bonnethead sharks may show a relationship between positive scaling and diet shifts. Bull sharks exhibited the greatest niche width, which supports their classification as a generalist predator. There was also a relatively high level of overlap of bull sharks with blacktips and bonnetheads. This was expected for blacktips, but was surprising for bonnetheads given their very little overlap in known prey species. The inclusion of a third tracer, such as sulfur, may improve the resolution of overlap among these species.&lt;/p&gt;
