    "text": "Software\n\nbayesmove\nAn R package for inferring latent behavioral states from animal movement data (telemetry and/or biologging) using non-parametric Bayesian methods. This includes features for pre-processing and analysis of data, as well as the visualization of model results. This framework does not rely on standard parametric probability density functions, which provides flexibility during model fitting. Further details regarding part of this framework can be found in Cullen et al. (2022) and Valle et al. (2022).\n\n\n\nShiny Applications\n\nGreen turtle occurrences compared to environmental layers\nThis app provides an interactive map for exploring green turtle (Chelonia mydas) tracks in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as along the coasts of Brazil and Qatar. Additionally, environmental layers (depth, net primary productivity, sea surface temperature) can be explored compared to turtle locations at each region on a monthly basis. These data are part of a study developing a transferable species distribution modeling approach.\n\n\nExploration of animal movement data\nThis app provides an interactive and dynamic platform for users to upload and visually explore their animal telemetry dataset. Options are provided to filter by each column of the uploaded data, as well as to interactively subset the individuals and time period that is being mapped. An interactive time series plot is linked to a Leaflet map for exploring particular patterns of interest within the data.\n\n\nInvasive species expert elicitation\nThis app was created to assist with data collection for an expert elicitation workshop on current distributions of invasive species in the southeast US. Users are first asked to define habitat suitability for a number of classes from the National Land Cover Database per species. Next, users are asked to define the intensity of species occurrence throughout the region on a raster map. I developed this novel interactive tool to be used as a layer of a Leaflet map. Additional info about the workshop can be found here.\n\n\nHawksbill sea turtle migrations\nSimilar to the ‘Exploration of animal movement data’ Shiny app, this is a simplified version that was used to explore migratory looping movements of hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) in the Arabian Gulf for a study discerning environmental drivers of movement patterns (Marshall et al., 2020). Users can still interactively and dynamically explore each of the tracks via a time series plot and Leaflet map, but with fewer options than the other app."

    "text": "Sea turtle life history\nThere are seven species of sea turtles worldwide, all of which have complex life cycles where they remain connected to both the land and ocean. While there are some differences by species and location, hatchlings initially emerge from the nesting beach and then make their way to the water to begin their oceanic phase where they remain in the open ocean for a few years before returning to nearshore developmental habitats as juveniles. Juvenile turtles typically remain at these sites for potentially years at a time while they grow before maturing into reproductive adults. Adults may travel over 1000 miles (1600 km) from foraging to breeding sites, where females will then remain before laying several clutches of eggs over the span of a few weeks before returning to foraging grounds. These highly migratory species are therefore at risk to a number of anthropogenic (human-caused) threats, including habitat degradation, risk of bycatch from commercial fishing, boat strikes, and coastal pollution, among others.\nGreen turtles follow the life cycle pattern described above, where they feed on primarily animal prey during their oceanic phase and then transition to an herbivorous diet upon settling in coastal developmental habitats as juveniles. As they continue to grow larger, green turtles often consume seagrasses and algae growing from the seafloor. This set of dietary preferences places great importance on seagrass meadows for this species, not to mention the large number of other coastal species that rely on seagrasses for food and shelter."
