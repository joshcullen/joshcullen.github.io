    "text": "I am an NSF Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow in Mariana Fuentes’ lab at Florida State University where I’m developing a transferable species distribution modeling approach. This includes the analysis of satellite telemetry data while accounting for habitat preferences of different age classes (e.g., juveniles, adults), spatial scale of environmental variables, and using a species’ physiology (e.g., thermal neutral zone) to inform habitat selection. In general, my research takes an integrative approach to understand how animals interact with their environment.\nGenerally, I am a quantitative ecologist with a passion for finding novel insights from large datasets. I am broadly interested in the ecological roles and movement patterns of vertebrate organisms to assess how sympatric species partition niche space and interact with their environment, respectively. I am also interested in data exploration, acquisition, and dissemination via interactive web applications (via Shiny), which may also serve as decision-support tools. I am particularly interested in using quantitative statistical methods (e.g., Bayesian models, state-space models, mixed effects (i.e. hierarchical) models, multivariate ordinations and clustering) and GIS to address complex ecological problems.\n\n\n\n PhD Wildlife & Fisheries Sciences, 2019 Texas A&M University\n BS Biological Sciences, 2013 Clemson University"

    "text": "Software\n\nbayesmove\nAn R package for inferring latent behavioral states from animal movement data (telemetry and/or biologging) using non-parametric Bayesian methods. This includes features for pre-processing and analysis of data, as well as the visualization of model results. This framework does not rely on standard parametric probability density functions, which provides flexibility during model fitting. Further details regarding part of this framework can be found in Cullen et al. (2022) and Valle et al. (2022).\n\n\n\nShiny Applications\n\nExploration of animal movement data\nThis app provides an interactive and dynamic platform for users to upload and visually explore their animal telemetry dataset. Options are provided to filter by each column of the uploaded data, as well as to interactively subset the individuals and time period that is being mapped. An interactive time series plot is linked to a Leaflet map for exploring particular patterns of interest within the data.\n\n\nInvasive species expert elicitation\nThis app was created to assist with data collection for an expert elicitation workshop on current distributions of invasive species in the southeast US. Users are first asked to define habitat suitability for a number of classes from the National Land Cover Database per species. Next, users are asked to define the intensity of species occurrence throughout the region on a raster map. I developed this novel interactive tool to be used as a layer of a Leaflet map. Additional info about the workshop can be found here.\n\n\nHawksbill sea turtle migrations\nSimilar to the ‘Exploration of animal movement data’ Shiny app, this is a simplified version that was used to explore migratory looping movements of hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) in the Arabian Gulf for a study discerning environmental drivers of movement patterns (Marshall et al., 2020). Users can still interactively and dynamically explore each of the tracks via a time series plot and Leaflet map, but with fewer options than the other app."
