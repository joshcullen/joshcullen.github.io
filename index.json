Ecological models have been used to make inferences on species-environment relationships in addition to predicting past and future patterns of species distributions. However, these models are typically developed for a single location, time period, spatial scale, or species life stage, resulting in poor predictive accuracy beyond the study domain. This project will provide a new transferable modeling approach that is applicable to a wide range of species, which will be used to test predictions of current and future distributions of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, and Qatar. Since there is a lack of information on how marine turtles in general will respond to climate change impacts, these results will provide a crucial evaluation of projected range shifts that could be used by both conservationists and decision makers. This project will foster the integration of research and education through mentoring undergraduate students that identify as underrepresented minorities, teaching marine ecology and conservation at Florida State University, hosting workshops on the analysis of animal movement data, as well as hosting public outreach events. These efforts to disseminate knowledge and results beyond traditional means within the scientific community will be used to engage future scientists and the general public on pressing ecological topics.\nThe overall aim of this project is to develop a transferable modeling approach that can provide accurate and precise estimates of species distributions under changing conditions. This study addresses some of the challenges of model transferability through three hypotheses: 1) a model informed by biological processes and physiological constraints will exhibit greater transferability than those that do not; 2) the analysis of environmental variables at the scale of species perception will result in greater model transferability; 3) a model that accounts for differences among life stages will result in greater model transferability. These hypotheses will be tested using a large dataset of green turtle occurrences at three distant locations (Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, Qatar) with a flexible Bayesian species distribution model. The use of independent datasets (from Brazil and Qatar) to validate the species distribution model (developed on data from the Gulf of Mexico) provides a unique opportunity to critically evaluate the spatial transferability of the model. The findings from this proposed work will provide a roadmap for the further development of transferable ecological models to predict biodiversity, disease outbreaks, and risks of biological invasions across global regions and possibly under future climate change impacts. Elucidating the importance of biological mechanisms, scale, and life stage differences to ecological modeling is transformative because these factors have been largely untested with regard to model transferability. Since predictions remain a major frontier in ecology, products of this work will be of broad interest to a diverse group of scientists, such as marine ecologists, biological oceanographers, fisheries scientists, and conservationists.\n","date":1629590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629590400,"objectID":"4b75176a8c5f8dfa1e612d6f5e281d08","permalink":"https://joshcullen.github.io/project/bayesian_transferable-sdm/","publishdate":"2021-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bayesian_transferable-sdm/","section":"project","summary":"Developing a new transferable modeling approach that applies hybrid SDMs to improve predictions of species distributions.","tags":["Movement Ecology","Quantitative Ecology","Bayesian Statistics","Sea Turtles"],"title":"Development of a Transferable Species Distribution Modeling Approach","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Movement decisions of an organism can impact habitat use, foraging strategies, reproductive success, and survival, which ultimately affects population dynamics of a species. The study of animal movement has increased in the past few decades, along with the increased capacity of telemetry devices to record locations with greater accuracy and over longer durations. Although there are a wide variety of existing methods that estimate latent behavioral states, many of these methods have limitations for their use and inference (e.g., only analyze one data stream, require parametric distributions).\nWe have developed two non-parametric Bayesian models that addresses some of the limitations of these existing methods for the estimation of animal behavioral states. One of these models uses a two-stage approach: 1) Multiple data streams (e.g., step length, turning angle, temperature, depth) are partitioned into track segments for each ID; 2) Track segments are pooled across IDs and clustered to determine the optimal number of states and their distributions per data stream. This proposed framework provides a fast and flexible method to characterize latent states at the level of track segments, which may be particularly useful when time steps are short (and therefore behavior is highly autocorrelated) and when distributions of data streams are not well fit by parametric distributions. Additionally, the other method uses a mixture model to infer observation-level behavioral state estimates using the same type of non-parametric clustering approach. Both of these models can be applied using functions included within the bayesmove package in R.\nThe two-stage segment-level model is described further in a pre-print at bioRxiv while the observation-level model is described further in an article that is \u0026lsquo;in press\u0026rsquo; at Ecological Applications.\n","date":1629590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629590400,"objectID":"10a93c7ed2507de15445f80954e56e9c","permalink":"https://joshcullen.github.io/project/bayesian-behavior-modeling/","publishdate":"2021-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bayesian-behavior-modeling/","section":"project","summary":"Developing new methods to extract more from animal movement data.","tags":["Movement Ecology","Quantitative Ecology","Bayesian Statistics"],"title":"Identifying Latent Behavioral States From Animal Biotelemetry Data Using Non-parametric Bayesian Methods","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Climate change is increasingly forcing organisms to alter their movement and behavioral patterns to meet the new physical demands within their historic ranges.

The Arabian Gulf is considered to be the hottest marine system in the world and is known for its extreme environmental conditions that pose substantial physiological stress on marine organisms living there. Satellite tags were deployed on hawksbill turtles in the Arabian Gulf and quantitative ecological modeling (i.e., Bayesian state-space models and GAMMs) was used to provide new insights into the ecological basis of observed hawksbill movement and behavior. Hawksbills used a relatively large core area in the southeast Arabian Gulf when transit and area-restricted search behaviors were included. The numerous hotspots identified suggest that important habitat occurs along a large area of the Qatari eastern coastline and into Saudi Arabia. Offshore islands with fringing reef habitat and deep-water habitats near the 30–50 m isobaths were intensely used. Hawksbills made seasonal migrations to deep-water habitat during summer months, typically once SST reached ∼33◦ C and bottom temperature reached ∼32◦ C. These data provide valuable information to managers seeking to conserve hawksbills in the region. Our data also provide a context to understand the underlying physiological, energetic and behavioral drivers of hawksbill movement in the Arabian Gulf. Future studies should include the use of biologging devices, benthic surveys, and dietary biomarkers to better understand the seasonal migrations of Arabian Gulf hawksbills to this deep-water region.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Environmental drivers of habitat use by hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) in the Arabian Gulf (Qatar)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Chase Lawson","Joshua A Cullen","Clifton C Nunnally","Gilbert T Rowe","David N Hala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604102400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604102400,"objectID":"7614336cd111243692ec39a9a886530f","permalink":"https://joshcullen.github.io/publication/deep-sea-burdens/","publishdate":"2020-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/deep-sea-burdens/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a paucity of information on the levels of PAHs and PCBs in the deep-sea ( 200 m).

Sharks are well known for their many rows of teeth and wide variety of shapes and sizes, but less is known about how tooth shape varies over ontogeny (growth and development). Additionally, the extent of differences in tooth shape within a single set of shark jaws has widely gone untested. Since these differences in tooth shape within a single jaw or over ontogeny can have implications for feeding performance and energy expenditure, the tooth morphology of bull (Carcharhinus leucas), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), and bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo) were analyzed since they are known to undergo ontogenetic dietary shifts and each feed on different types of prey.\nSignificant differences in tooth morphology were only observed in bull sharks at four different positions (of six) tested. However, only one of these appears to have any functional differences in shape over ontogeny. When comparing tooth morphology throughout the jaws of each species, bull sharks exhibited the greatest heterodonty. A comparison of teeth at each jaw position among all three species found significant differences at all but two positions (where bull and blacktips were similar). These findings support the generalist feeding strategy of bull sharks that may need a greater variety of tooth shapes to process prey with different material properties. Blacktip and bonnethead sharks had much less heterodonty throughout their jaws, indicative of specialists on fish and crustaceans, respectively. It is possible that the tooth morphology of each species may confer an increased net energy intake with teeth that are well suited to process certain types of prey than other types of prey those species typically do not consume.\nPublished work on this topic can be found here.\n","date":1583539200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583539200,"objectID":"36b4788b2467ede5120580acf49ac2d0","permalink":"https://joshcullen.github.io/project/shark-tooth-morphology/","publishdate":"2020-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/shark-tooth-morphology/","section":"project","summary":"Tooth morphology varies within and among sharks and may facilitate increased net energy intake.","tags":["Morphology","Elliptic Fourier Analysis","Teeth","Feeding","Sharks"],"title":"Ecological Morphology of Shark Teeth","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Many animals undergo ontogenetic dietary shifts over their life history, especially predatory species. This is often a result of greater physical performance, prey availability, and energetic requirements. Many shark species have been documented to shift species that they consume over ontogeny, but the mechanisms facilitating this shift have not been directly addressed. One primary driver of this shift may be due to changes in bite force, which would allow sharks to potentially consume more functionally difficult prey (more evasive, larger, harder). Additionally, coastal shark species often overlap in habitat and potentially in diet. Dietary tracers, such as stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, have often been used to determine the extent of niche space and overlap among co-occurring species. Bull (Carcharhinus leucas), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), and bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo) were measured evaluate how the scaling of bite force over ontogeny influences ecological niche and overlap since these species have been previously shown to undergo dietary shifts and have distinct ecological niches.\nWhile many studies that measure the scaling of bite force over ontogeny often analyze all conspecifics simultaneously, this may mask any changing patterns in bite force. Therefore, young-of-the-year and juvenile sharks of each species were analyzed separately from sub-adults and adults. This study found that the smaller shark all underwent positive allometric scaling of bite force, whereas larger sharks exhibited isometry. While rapid increases in bite force did not appear to necessarily facilitate a diet shift in blacktips, it appears that bull and bonnethead sharks may show a relationship between positive scaling and diet shifts. Bull sharks exhibited the greatest niche width, which supports their classification as a generalist predator. There was also a relatively high level of overlap of bull sharks with blacktips and bonnetheads.

In sharks, differences in morphology may facilitate the capture and handling of prey with different physical properties. However, few studies have investigated differences in tooth morphology over ontogeny, throughout the jaws of a single species, or among species at multiple tooth positions. Bull (Carcharhinus leucas), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), and bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo) are coastal predators that exhibit ontogenetic dietary shifts, but differ in their feeding ecologies. This study measured tooth morphology at six positions along the upper and lower jaws of each species using elliptic Fourier analysis to make comparisons within and among species over their ontogeny. Significant ontogenetic differences were detected at four of the six tooth positions in bull sharks, but only the posterior position on the lower jaw appeared to exhibit a functionally relevant shift in morphology. No ontogenetic changes in morphology were detected in blacktip or bonnethead sharks. Intraspecific comparisons found that most tooth positions significantly differed from one another across all species, but heterodonty was greatest in bull sharks. Additionally, interspecific comparisons found differences among all species at each tooth position except between bull and blacktip sharks at two positions. These morphological patterns within and among species may have implications for prey handling efficiency, as well as in providing insight for paleoichthyology studies and reevaluating heterodonty in sharks.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Do sharks exhibit heterodonty by tooth position and over ontogeny?

The potential toxicity of these burdens was evaluated by calculation of toxic equivalents (TEQs). Concentrations of total PAHs ($\\Sigma$PAHs) were significantly greater in blacktip and bonnethead sharks than bull sharks in liver, but did not exhibit differences in muscle among species. Hepatic concentrations of $\\Sigma$PAHs in these sharks (range of means 1560–2200 ng/g wet wt.) were greater than concentrations previously reported in oysters from Galveston Bay (range of means 134–333 ng/g dry wt.), which suggests that trophic dilution of PAHs may not be reflected in sharks. Total PCBs ($\\Sigma$PCBs) were significantly greatest in bull sharks and lowest in bonnetheads, while blacktips were intermediate to these species. EROD activity was greater in bonnetheads than the other species, whereas GST activity was significantly higher in blacktips and bonnetheads than in bull sharks. Integration of hepatic burdens with biomarker activity via constrained multivariate analysis found correlations for only a small number of individual PAH/PCB congeners. Hepatic TEQ measurements suggest potential physiological effects of these burdens compared to established TEQ thresholds for other taxa, although the likelihood of similar effects in sharks requires further study and the inclusion of toxic endpoints. Our findings indicate that sharks may be prone to the accumulation of PAHs and PCBs, which may result in negative health outcomes for these cartilaginous fishes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Integration of multi-tissue PAH and PCB burdens with biomarker activity in three coastal shark species from the northwestern Gulf of Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Hala","Joshua A Cullen","Beatrice Hernout","Ivan Ivanov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"cf00a84499bb788f32a40ee6f85e3350","permalink":"https://joshcullen.github.io/publication/theoretical-tf-model/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/theoretical-tf-model/","section":"publication","summary":"Oocyte development and maturation (or oogenesis) in spawning female fish is mediated by interrelated transcriptional regulatory and steroidogenesis networks. This study integrates a transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) model of steroidogenic enzyme gene expressions with a flux balance analysis (FBA) model of steroidogenesis. The two models were functionally related. Output from the TRN model (as magnitude gene expression simulated using extreme pathway (ExPa) analysis) was used to re-constrain linear inequality bounds for reactions in the FBA model. This allowed TRN model predictions to impact the steroidogenesis FBA model. These two interrelated models were tested as follows; First, in silico targeted steroidogenic enzyme gene activations in the TRN model showed high co-regulation (67–83%) for genes involved with oocyte growth and development (cyp11a1, cyp17-17,20-lyase, 3β-HSD and cyp19a1a). Whereas, no or low co-regulation corresponded with genes concertedly involved with oocyte final maturation prior to spawning (cyp17-17α-hydroxylase (0%) and 20β-HSD (33%)). Analysis (using FBA) of accompanying steroidogenesis fluxes showed high overlap for enzymes involved with oocyte growth and development versus those involved with final maturation and spawning. Second, the TRN model was parameterized with in vivo changes in the presence/absence of transcription factors (TFs) during oogenesis in female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Oogenesis stages studied included; PreVitellogenic-Vitellogenic, Vitellogenic-Mature, Mature-Ovulated and Ovulated-Atretic stages. Predictions of TRN genes active during oogenesis showed overall elevated expressions for most genes during early oocyte development (PreVitellogenic-Vitellogenic, Vitellogenic-Mature) and post-ovulation (Ovulated-Atretic). Whereas ovulation (Mature-Ovulated) showed highest expression for cyp17-17α-hydroxylase only. FBA showed steroid hormone productions to also follow trends concomitant with steroidogenic enzyme gene expressions. General trends predicted by in silico modeling were similar to those observed in vivo. The integrated computational framework presented was capable of mechanistically representing aspects of reproductive function in fish. This approach can be extended to study reproductive effects under exposure to adverse environmental or anthropogenic stressors.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"In silico predicted transcriptional regulatory control of steroidogenesis in spawning female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher D Marshall","Mehsin Al Ansi","Jennifer Dupont","Christopher Warren","Ismail Al Shaikh","Joshua A Cullen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519862400,"objectID":"8e83f129626dca0a7a3154bd4e88052b","permalink":"https://joshcullen.github.io/publication/dugong-aggregation/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dugong-aggregation/","section":"publication","summary":"Dugongs (*Dugong dugon*) are large herbivorous marine mammals of the order Sirenia commonly referred to as sea cows. Due to their herbivorous diet, feeding and foraging dominate their natural history. Dugongs have evolved a specialized feeding apparatus for efficient grazing and processing of sea grass, which can occur by cropping blades or the excavation of roots and rhizomes (Marsh et al. 1999; Marshall et al. 2003; Lanyon and Sanson 2006a,b). The excavation of seagrasses results in sig- nature benthic feeding trails in which 60%–90% of the vegetation may be removed (Heinsohn et al. 1977; Preen 1992, 1995; Marsh et al. 2011). Sediment plumes from dugong foraging are easily observed during aerial surveys. Due to their low reproductive output, dugongs are vulnerable to perturbations in their environment, such as habitat degradation, fisheries bycatch and contaminants (Baldwin and Cockcroft 1997, Marsh et al. 2011, Reynolds and Marshall 2012) from which populations may be slow to recover...","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Large dugong (Dugong dugon) aggregations persist in coastal Qatar","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua A Cullen","Takashi Maie","Heiko L Schoenfuss","Richard W Blob"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1357257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1357257600,"objectID":"7c6f77d2322ed663abd4c7afcfc2daf8","permalink":"https://joshcullen.github.io/publication/goby-oral-kinematics/","publishdate":"2013-01-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/goby-oral-kinematics/","section":"publication","summary":"Species exposed to extreme environments often exhibit distinctive traits that help meet the demands of such habitats. Such traits could evolve independently, but under intense selective pressures of extreme environments some existing structures or behaviors might be coopted to meet specialized demands, evolving via the process of exaptation. We evaluated the potential for exaptation to have operated in the evolution of novel behaviors of the waterfall-climbing gobiid fish genus Sicyopterus. These fish use an “inching” behavior to climb waterfalls, in which an oral sucker is cyclically protruded and attached to the climbing surface. They also exhibit a distinctive feeding behavior, in which the premaxilla is cyclically protruded to scrape diatoms from the substrate. Given the similarity of these patterns, we hypothesized that one might have been coopted from the other. To evaluate this, we filmed climbing and feeding in *Sicyopterus stimpsoni* from Hawai’i, and measured oral kinematics for two comparisons. First, we compared feeding kinematics of *S. stimpsoni* with those for two suction feeding gobiids (*Awaous guamensis* and *Lentipes concolor*), assessing what novel jaw movements were required for algal grazing. Second, we quantified the similarity of oral kinematics between feeding and climbing in *S. stimpsoni*, evaluating the potential for either to represent an exaptation from the other. Premaxillary movements showed the greatest differences between scraping and suction feeding taxa. Between feeding and climbing, overall profiles of oral kinematics matched closely for most variables in *S. stimpsoni*, with only a few showing significant differences in maximum values. Although current data cannot resolve whether oral movements for climbing were coopted from feeding, or feeding movements coopted from climbing, similarities between feeding and climbing kinematics in *S. stimpsoni* are consistent with evidence of exaptation, with modifications, between these behaviors. Such comparisons can provide insight into the evolutionary mechanisms facilitating exploitation of extreme habitats.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Evolutionary Novelty versus Exaptation; Oral Kinematics in Feeding versus Climbing in the Waterfall-Climbing Hawaiian Goby Sicyopterus stimpsoni","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://joshcullen.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
